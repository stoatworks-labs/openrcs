 * An audio worklet that decodes nothing.
 *
 * It forwards mono sample blocks to the main thread and stops there, on
 * purpose. A worklet runs in its own realm with no module imports — `addModule`
 * loads a classic script — so decoding in here would mean a second copy of
 * `core/timecode.js` living in a file nobody would remember to keep in step.
 * One decoder, fed from wherever the samples come from, is worth the postMessage.
 *
 * 48 kHz of mono Float32 is about 190 KB/s across the port, which is nothing
 * next to the device store this app already mirrors.
