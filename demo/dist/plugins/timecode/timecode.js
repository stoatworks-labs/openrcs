/*
 * Timecode: MIDI and audio, decoded into one shape.
 *
 * A cue stack that chases timecode needs to know the time and to know when it
 * has stopped being told the time. Both of those are harder than they look,
 * and neither is specific to a transport, so both live here — pure, with no
 * MIDI port, no audio node and no clock of its own beyond what is handed in.
 *
 * ## Two sources, one answer
 *
 * **MTC** (MIDI Time Code) arrives two ways. *Quarter-frame* messages carry
 * one nibble each, eight of them spanning **two frames**, so a whole timecode
 * takes 8 messages and is already two frames old by the time it completes —
 * the standard says the reader adds 2. *Full-frame* messages are a SysEx
 * carrying the whole thing at once, sent on locate rather than continuously.
 *
 * **LTC** (Linear Time Code) is an audio signal: 80 bits per frame,
 * biphase-mark encoded, with a sync word at the end that also says which
 * direction the tape is running.
 *
 * Both end up as `{ hours, minutes, seconds, frames, rate, dropFrame }`.
 *
 * ## The thing that matters more than decoding
 *
 * **Timecode stops without saying so.** A deck paused, a cable pulled and a
 * generator switched off all look identical: the messages simply cease. So a
 * chase that trusts its last reading forever will sit there believing the show
 * is still running. `TimecodeClock` free-wheels for a short, stated window and
 * then declares itself stale, and the difference between "running" and "was
 * running" is the whole reason it exists.
