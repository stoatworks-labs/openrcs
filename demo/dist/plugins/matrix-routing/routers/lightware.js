/*
 * Lightware, both generations, behind one driver.
 *
 * ⚠️ **READ THIS BEFORE TRUSTING A LINE OF IT.** Unlike the Videohub driver —
 * which is a port of code that was exercised against a working implementation
 * of its protocol — **nothing in this file has been run against a Lightware
 * frame.** It is written from Lightware's published protocol documentation.
 * The command spellings are collected in `LW3` and `LW2` below precisely so
 * that correcting them against a real frame is an edit to one table rather
 * than an archaeology expedition through the parser.
 *
 * Where this file is *defensive* — accepting several shapes of the same
 * answer, and polling even after subscribing — that is not belt and braces.
 * It is an admission: the exact framing of an unsolicited change differs
 * across the LW3 families (MX2, UBEX, Taurus UCX) and I cannot prove which
 * one a given frame sends. Polling makes the grid correct regardless, and the
 * subscription makes it fast when it works. Take the polling out only once a
 * real frame has shown you its push format.
 *
 * ## The two protocols are unrelated
 *
 * **LW2** (TCP 10001, legacy MX-series and older) is a terse ASCII protocol:
 * commands in braces, answers in parentheses.
 *
 * ```text
 *   {1@3}        route input 1 to output 3
 *   (O03 I01)    ...done
 * ```
 *
 * **LW3** (TCP 6107, everything current) is a property tree with typed
 * accessors. A crosspoint is a method call on a node, and the routing table is
 * one property holding a semicolon-separated list.
 *
 * ```text
 *   GET /MEDIA/VIDEO/XP.DestinationConnectionList
 *   pr /MEDIA/VIDEO/XP.DestinationConnectionList=I1;I1;I5;I2
 *   CALL /MEDIA/VIDEO/XP:switch(I3:O2)
 *   mO /MEDIA/VIDEO/XP:switch
 * ```
 *
 * In that list the *position* is the destination and the *value* is the
 * source: position 3 holding `I5` means output 3 is showing input 5. Both are
 * 1-based, which is the one mercy this file gets — no conversion, unlike the
 * Videohub.
 *
 * ## Which one am I talking to
 *
 * The port is a strong hint and not a promise, so the driver **asks**. On
 * connect it sends an LW3 read; an LW3 frame answers with a `pr`/`pw` line and
 * an LW2 frame does not. If nothing LW3-shaped arrives inside
 * `DETECT_TIMEOUT_MS`, it tries LW2's product query and listens for a
 * parenthesised answer. A frame that answers neither is reported as connected
 * but unidentified rather than guessed at, because guessing means sending
 * `{1@3}` at something that might take it as part of a different command.
