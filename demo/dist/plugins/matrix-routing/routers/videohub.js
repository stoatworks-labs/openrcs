/*
 * Blackmagic Videohub Ethernet Protocol, client side. TCP 9990.
 *
 * ## Provenance
 *
 * The block parser and the handling below are a port of the client in
 * **BlackMatrix** (`packages/videohub/src/{client,protocol}.ts`,
 * stoatworks-labs/blackmatrix), which is this author's own and where the
 * protocol was actually exercised — against a real ATEM fleet serving the
 * protocol, a raw TCP client and telnet. It is a port and not a dependency
 * because that repo is TypeScript with a build step and this one is plain ESM
 * with none, deliberately; and because two of the three drivers here have no
 * upstream at all, so a shared package would carry one of three.
 *
 * ⚠️ **What has never happened, there or here: a real Videohub.** BlackMatrix's
 * README says so in as many words and it is still true. The protocol is
 * implemented from Blackmagic's published "Videohub Developer Information"
 * (v2.3, May 2018) and proven against an emulation of it. Prove it on your own
 * router before a show.
 *
 * ## The wire
 *
 * Blocks: an ALL-CAPS header ending in a colon, zero or more lines, a blank
 * line. A block with no lines is a request for a dump; a block with lines is a
 * status update — and clients ask for changes in exactly the form the server
 * reports them, which is why one parser serves both directions.
 *
 * ```text
 *   VIDEO OUTPUT ROUTING:
 *   0 3
 *
 * ```
 *
 * ## ⚠️ The zero-based trap
 *
 * **The Videohub wire counts from 0 and everything else in this app counts
 * from 1.** Output 1 on the front panel is `0` in that block. This file is the
 * only place in the repo that knows it — `core/patch.js` says so, and the
 * conversion happens in exactly two places below, both marked. Getting it
 * wrong routes a real crosspoint one off from the one asked for, which is a
 * mistake nobody spots until it is on a screen.
 *
 * ## Refusals are silent by design
 *
 * A route the router will not make is answered with ACK and then the
 * *unchanged* routing — not NAK, which means it did not understand. So a
 * refusal is indistinguishable from a command that never arrived, except that
 * the state does not move. That is the protocol's own choice and the reason
 * the driver layer never writes its own state.
