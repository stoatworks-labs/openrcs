/*
 * Turtle AV, the ASCII command set. TCP 8000.
 *
 * Written from *8x8 4K60 VIDEOWALL AND MULTIVIEW — User Manual* (Turtle AV,
 * 2025; device type `HDP-MXB88VW`), section 10, "RS-232 Control Command".
 * **Not verified against a unit.** The same warning the Lightware driver
 * carries applies here, with one thing in its favour: this protocol is small
 * enough to read in full, and the manual gives an example and a feedback
 * string for every command.
 *
 * ## The wire
 *
 * ASCII, one command per line, **terminated by `!`** rather than by the
 * newline — which is the detail that catches anyone who sees "ASCII" and
 * reaches for a line codec. Answers are plain English lines.
 *
 * ```text
 *   s output 1 in source 3!      route input 3 to output 1
 *   output 1->input 3
 *
 *   r output 0 in source!        ask about every output (0 = all)
 *   output 1->input 3
 *   output 2->input 2
 *   ...
 * ```
 *
 * **`0` means "all"** in the output position, on both the read and the write.
 * That is how the whole table is fetched, and it is also a live grenade: `s
 * output 0 in source 1!` puts input 1 on every output at once. Nothing in this
 * driver ever sends output 0 as a write, and `route()` rejects it, because the
 * only way to reach it is a bug in the caller — `core/patch.js` counts
 * destinations from 1.
 *
 * Errors come back as a bare code: `E00` unknown command, `E01` parameter out
 * of range, `E02` bad EDID data.
 *
 * ## It volunteers nothing, so it is polled
 *
 * The manual documents a reply for every command and no unsolicited output. A
 * route taken at the front panel or in the web GUI is therefore invisible here
 * until the next poll — a real limitation of the protocol, stated in the UI,
 * not hidden.
 *
 * ## How big is it
 *
 * The device does not serve a port count. Two sources, in this order:
 *
 * 1. **The routing reply.** `r output 0 in source!` answers one line per
 *    output, so counting them is authoritative for the output side.
 * 2. **The model name.** `r type!` answers `HDP-MXB88VW`, in which `88` is
 *    8 in by 8 out. An even run of digits is split down the middle; an odd one
 *    is not guessed at. This is a *hint* and is only ever used to fill in the
 *    input count, which the routing reply cannot give — an input nothing is
 *    routed to never appears in it.
