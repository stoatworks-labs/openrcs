/*
 * Firing cues off timecode.
 *
 * A cue may carry a timecode. When the incoming timecode passes it, the cue
 * fires. That sentence hides four decisions, and every one of them is the
 * difference between a chase that runs a show and one that ruins it.
 *
 * ## 1. A cue fires once per pass, not once per reading
 *
 * Timecode arrives many times a second. "Position is past the cue" is true for
 * every one of those readings, so firing on the condition would fire the cue
 * continuously. The chase remembers what it has fired and only fires a cue on
 * the reading that *crosses* it.
 *
 * ## 2. Going backwards re-arms
 *
 * A rehearsal runs the same three minutes twenty times. Once the timecode is
 * back before a cue, that cue is due again — otherwise the second run of the
 * scene does nothing and the operator is left pressing GO by hand while
 * wondering what is wrong.
 *
 * ## 3. Jumping forward does NOT run everything it skipped
 *
 * This is the one that would do damage. Locating from 00:01:00 to 01:30:00
 * must not fire every cue in between as fast as the device will take them —
 * that is a hundred takes in a second, on air. On a jump the chase *catches
 * up*: everything before the new position is marked as already done, silently,
 * and the show continues from there.
 *
 * A jump is any move the clock reports as one, which it does when the
 * position moves by more than a second between readings. Ordinary running
 * never does that.
 *
 * ## 4. Nothing fires while the feed is stale
 *
 * A stopped generator and a paused deck look identical, and the clock reports
 * a stale feed as having no position at all. No position, no firing.
