/*
 * A placeholder router: the right number of inputs and outputs, and a routing
 * table, with nothing on the other end.
 *
 * This is how a show is patched and routed before the real router is on the
 * network — see `../library.js`. It is **not** an emulator of any protocol:
 * there is no socket, no wire format and nothing to prove. It exists so every
 * surface that routes can be driven against the simulator unchanged.
 *
 * ## The one place a driver writes its own state
 *
 * `driver.js` forbids it, and for a real router that rule is the whole
 * layer. Here there is no router to ask: the placeholder *is* the router, so a
 * crosspoint taken is a crosspoint made, and the grid moves on the click. What
 * it reports is therefore exactly as true as a real router's report — it is
 * just that nobody else can change it.
 *
 * The crosspoints actually taken on it are the **plan** (`planned`): the
 * server saves them into the router's configuration on every change, so they
 * survive a restart, travel in the setup file, and are still there to push
 * once the router goes live. Only what was taken — the factory routing below
 * is not part of it, because pushing it would overwrite every output on the
 * real frame, including the ones the show never touches.
 *
 * ## Factory routing
 *
 * A fresh placeholder routes output N from input N (the last input, past the
 * end), which is how a Videohub and a Lightware MX2 ship. A table with holes
 * in it would draw "nothing" in the Now column for a real router that is never
 * showing nothing.
